	// Components lifecycle goes through the following phases:
	//
	// 1. Creation. The component is created using the factory, via Create* call.
	// 2. Start. The component's Start() method is called.
	// 3. Running. The component is up and running.
	// 4. Shutdown. The component's Shutdown() method is called, the lifecycle is complete.
	//
	// Once the lifecycle is complete it may be repeated, in which case a new component
	// is created and goes through the lifecycle.

	// Start tells the component to start. Host parameter can be used for communicating
	// with the host after Start() has already returned. If error is returned by
	// Start() then the collector startup will be aborted.
	// If this is an exporter component it may prepare for exporting
	// by connecting to the endpoint.
	//
	// If the component needs to perform a long-running starting operation then it is recommended
	// that Start() returns quickly and the long-running operation is performed in background.
	// In that case make sure that the long-running operation does not use the context passed
	// to Start() function since that context will be cancelled soon and can abort the long-running operation.
	// Create a new context from the context.Background() for long-running operations.
	Start(ctx context.Context, host Host) error

	// Shutdown is invoked during service shutdown. After Shutdown() is called, if the component accept data in
	// any way, it should not accept it anymore.
	//
	// If there are any background operations running by the component they must be aborted as soon as possible.
	// Remember that if you started any long-running background operation from the Start() method that operation
	// must be also cancelled. If there are any buffer in the component, it should be cleared and the data sent
	// immediately to the next component.
	//
	// Once the Shutdown() method returns the component's lifecycle is completed. No other
	// methods of the component are called after that. If necessary a new component with
	// the same or different configuration may be created and started (this may happen
	// for example if we want to restart the component).
